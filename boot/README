This is a collection of useful tools for system recovery and whatnot. It is not intended to be as complete as something like Knoppix, but it's good for taking drive snapshots, testing memory and disks, etc.

The "core" contains:
- memtest86+
- x86test
- Hardware Detection Tool
- FreeDOS

This weighs in at about 3.5MB, suitable even for tiny USB sticks and flash cards.

As optional modules, you can also install:
- MicroCore Linux 6.1 (10MB)
- TinyCore Linux 6.1 (16MB)
- TinyCore Linux 6.1 + wifi support (61MB)
- CorePlus Linux Installer 6.1 (75MB)
- Puppy Linux 5.7 (161MB)
- Puppy Linux 6.0 (198MB)

Note that the first two do not have any support for wifi connections, although it can be loaded after boot if you have a working wired connection.

These modules will download additional components the first time they're installed, so make sure you have a net connection. If you want to pre-download these components for later use, run:

    ./mkrescue -m pre $(ls modules)

and it will download them but do nothing else.

Adding new systems and tools is easy. Small things can go in the core; look at /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg for the current setup. Larger things should be optional modules; look in modules/ for examples, specifically at the .rescue files in those modules, which contains module-specific configs.
